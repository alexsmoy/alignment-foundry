# Stage 05 — Artifact Assembly

**One job**: Assemble all confirmed outputs into final, formatted deliverables ready for use.

**No new skill to load** — this stage assembles; it does not analyze.

**Input**: All previous stage `output/` folders plus `01-intake/output/artifact-selection.md`

---

## What this stage does

Stage 05 is the assembly and formatting stage. You are not generating new analysis —
you are taking all the work produced in Stages 01–04 and assembling it into the
final artifacts the human selected at intake.

Read `01-intake/output/artifact-selection.md` first. Produce only the artifacts that were
selected. Do not produce artifacts that weren't requested.

## The 10 artifacts

| ID | Name | Sources | Format |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| A1 | SIPOC Summary | Stage 01 output | Markdown table |
| A2 | Decomposition Tree | Stage 02 output | Indented markdown |
| A3 | Flow Diagram | Stage 02 output | Mermaid code block |
| A4 | Automation Scorecard | Stage 03 output | Table per step |
| A5 | Technology Fit Matrix | Stage 03 output | Grouped table |
| A6 | PACE Analysis | Stage 04 output | Structured blocks |
| A7 | RACI Matrix | Stage 04 output | Table |
| A8 | Value Stream Summary | Stage 03 + 04 data | Table + metrics |
| A9 | Implementation Roadmap | Stage 03 tier summary | Phased plan |
| A10 | Process Spec Sheet | All stages | Full document |

## Assembly instructions per artifact

### A1 — SIPOC Summary
Copy from `01-intake/output/sipoc.md`. Clean formatting only. No new content.

### A2 — Decomposition Tree
Copy from `02-decompose/output/decomposition.md`. Confirm hierarchy is intact and
annotations are present. Add a legend if actor codes are used.

### A3 — Flow Diagram
Copy Mermaid block from `02-decompose/output/flow-diagram.md`.
Validate that stage labels match A2 stage names exactly.
Add a plain-language description above the diagram.

### A4 — Automation Scorecard
Copy from `03-analyze/output/automation-scorecard.md`.
Add a summary row at the top: total steps scored, breakdown by tier.

### A5 — Technology Fit Matrix
Copy from `03-analyze/output/tech-fit-matrix.md`.
Group by technology category, not by step.
Add brief description of each technology category recommended.

### A6 — PACE Analysis
Copy from `04-pace-raci/output/pace-analysis.md`.
Add a summary table at the top: step → tiers covered → key trigger.

### A7 — RACI Matrix
Copy from `04-pace-raci/output/raci-matrix.md`.
Include the flags section. Add a legend for R/A/C/I.

### A8 — Value Stream Summary
Synthesize from Stage 03 scoring data and Stage 02 annotations.
Estimate cycle time vs wait time per stage. Calculate process efficiency.
Flag the top 3 waste opportunities.

Template:
```markdown
| Stage | Cycle Time | Wait Time | Value-Add? | Primary Waste |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| [name] | [est] | [est] | Yes/No/Partial | [waste type] |

**Process efficiency**: [cycle time total] / [lead time total] = [%]
**Top waste opportunities**: [1], [2], [3]
```

### A9 — Implementation Roadmap
Build from `03-analyze/output/tier-summary.md`.
Organize into phases by dependency, not just priority.

Template:
```markdown
## Phase 1 — Quick Wins (0–30 days)
Steps: [Tier 1 steps with no dependencies]
Technology: [specific tools]
Effort: [estimate]
Outcome: [what improves]

## Phase 2 — AI Integration (30–90 days)
...

## Phase 3 — Full Orchestration (90–180 days)
...

## Phase 4 — Monitoring & Optimization (ongoing)
...
```

### A10 — Process Spec Sheet
Use template from `_core/patterns/process-spec-sheet-template.md`.
Populate every section from previous stage outputs.
This is the formal document — clean language, consistent formatting.

---

## Output files — write to `output/`

One file per artifact produced. Name them:
`A1-sipoc.md`, `A2-decomposition.md`, `A3-flow-diagram.md`, etc.

For A10, use: `A10-process-spec-sheet.md`

---

## Human edit window

Tell the human:
> "Stage 05 complete. All requested artifacts are in `05-artifacts/output/`.
> These are your final deliverables — review them as you would any document you'd share
> with stakeholders. If anything needs revision, edit the files directly.
> If you want to activate ongoing monitoring (Stage 06), let me know.
> Otherwise, this run is complete."

Update `_state.md`: current stage → complete (or 06 if monitoring is being activated).

## Done checklist

- [ ] One output file per selected artifact
- [ ] A10 (if selected) fully populated from all stage outputs
- [ ] A3 Mermaid diagram syntactically valid
- [ ] A9 roadmap phases ordered by dependency (not just priority)
- [ ] All artifact names match `A[N]-[slug].md` convention
- [ ] `_state.md` updated to reflect completion
