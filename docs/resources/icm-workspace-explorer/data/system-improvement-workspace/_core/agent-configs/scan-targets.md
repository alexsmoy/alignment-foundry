## Active targets

```yaml
targets:
  - id: target-001
    name: [service or repo name]
    type: [code / infra / runtime / all]
    environment: [dev / staging / production]
    credential_ref: [reference to credential store — never paste credentials here]
    agents:
      - code-quality
      - security
      - deps
    notes: [any scan-specific context]

  - id: target-002
    name: [service or repo name]
    type: runtime
    environment: production
    credential_ref: [reference]
    agents:
      - performance
