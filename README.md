# Alignment Foundry

> *The workshop behind the work. Build ideas, industry insights, and resources for enterprise AI alignment.*

AI doesn't fail because of technology. It fails because leaders, teams, and strategies aren't aligned. This repo is where I build toward solving that problem — in public.

**Alignment Foundry** is the workspace behind [alexsmoy.com](https://alexsmoy.com). It hosts the tools, ideas, and thinking I'm developing at the intersection of enterprise AI strategy, Centers of Excellence, and coalition-building.

The published site lives at **[alexsmoy.github.io/alignment-foundry](https://alexsmoy.github.io/alignment-foundry)**.

## Philosophy

When leaders are equipped and organizations are united, AI delivers more than growth. It creates legacy.

Everything in this repo is guided by one principle: **AI should be a tool, not a takeover.** That means building systems with governance, grounding innovation in accountability, and always keeping people at the center of transformation.
