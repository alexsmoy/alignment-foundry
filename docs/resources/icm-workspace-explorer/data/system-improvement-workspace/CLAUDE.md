# System Improvement Workspace
## Interpretable Context Methodology — Agent Context File

**Workspace type**: Multi-agent scanning pipeline — find, fix, validate, deploy, learn
**ICM version**: 1.0

---

## What this workspace does

Runs a coordinated pipeline of specialized scanning agents against a software system or
infrastructure target. Agents detect issues across 10 domains, a coordinator clusters
findings by root cause, a remediation agent generates fix proposals, a CI pipeline
validates them, and a human approves before production deployment.

Every run produces: correlated findings, prioritized fix proposals with diffs,
validation results, human review queue, deployment records, and an outcome-linked changelog.

---

## How to orient yourself

1. Check `_state.md` — last scan time, current queue depth, active targets.
2. Read the current STAGE.md for whichever stage needs action.
3. Load the ops-intelligence skill only for Stage 01 (sensing) and Stage 02 (correlation).
4. All other stages operate from their STAGE.md and previous stage outputs.

## Stage map

```
01-scan/          10 agents scan in parallel across all domains.
02-correlate/     Coordinator clusters findings by root cause.
03-fix-gen/       Remediation agent drafts specific, testable fixes.
04-validate/      CI pipeline applies fixes to dev/staging — reports results.
05-human-review/  Human reviews diff + test result + reasoning → approves/rejects.
06-deploy-learn/  Approved changes deployed. Outcomes measured. Changelog updated.
```

## Skills

| Skill | File | Load when |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Ops Intelligence | `_core/skills/ops-intelligence/SKILL.md` | Stages 01 and 02 |

No other skills are needed — this workspace is self-contained.

## Hard rules

1. No fix is ever auto-applied to production. Human review in Stage 05 is mandatory.
2. The coordinator (Stage 02) must run before fix generation (Stage 03) — never skip correlation.
3. Validation (Stage 04) runs before human review (Stage 05) — never ask a human to review
   an untested fix when testing is possible.
4. Never modify: IAM policies, production databases (schema), firewall rules, secrets.
   These require a second human reviewer regardless of severity.
5. Rejected fixes are logged with reasons — they are not immediately re-submitted.
6. Every production deployment has a rollback plan in the fix proposal.

## Scan targets

Define scan targets in `_core/agent-configs/scan-targets.md` before running Stage 01.
Each target specifies: environment, credential reference, scope, and which agents to run.

## Token budget

This file: ~350 tokens (always in context)
Current STAGE.md: ~350 tokens (swap per stage)
Ops Intelligence skill: ~2,000 tokens (Stages 01–02 only)
Stage input files: ~500–2,000 tokens per stage
Total typical context: ~3,000–5,000 tokens per stage
