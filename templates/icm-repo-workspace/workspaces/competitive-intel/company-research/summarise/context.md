# Summarise

## Purpose

Extract the key financial and product metrics from the sources gathered in the
previous stage into a single structured record.

## Receives

- `gather-sources/fetch-10q/output.md` — the latest filing reference.
- `gather-sources/fetch-news/output.md` — recent news items.

## Produces

- `extract-metrics/output.json` — structured metrics with source citations.

## Tasks (ordered)

1. **extract-metrics** — Pull revenue, growth, and notable product moves into a
   structured record.

## Constraints

- Every extracted value cites the source it came from.
- A missing metric is recorded as `null` with a note — never estimated.
